				<p>The Residential Curriculum Model is an approach that is designed to help RAs intentionally create educational experiences in the residence halls. It is guided by educational priorities that are directly tied to the mission of the Department of Residence Life.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Educational Priorities</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will be members of an environment that promotes learning outside of the classroom through faculty interactions and an emphasis on university resources while also supporting the connection between academic and personal growth.</li>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will develop communication skills and conflict management skills needed to effectively navigate challenges and opportunities while taking ownership of their choices.</li>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <li><b>Community Commitment</b> - Residential students will engage in meaningful interactions and build diverse relationships to develop appreciation for shared experiences and a respect for their community.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <p>Each task that you will complete as an RA supports these priorities. Explore this site for information about your responsibilities so that your residents will become better educated individuals for having lived and learned with you.</p>
