                <p>October is when we begin to see roommate and suitemate conflicts surface. The school year is no longer new and shiny, and behaviors that weren’t such a big deal at the beginning are now becoming aggravating. Even if roommate relationships are going well, our residents are experiencing other types of conflict, as well, whether they are wrestling through a group project in class, struggling with colleagues at work, or having difficulties with family. Fighting is unavoidable, so learn how to fight fair!</p>
                
                <p>The learning outcomes met by this month’s bulletin board, program, and resident interactions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will actively engage in a learning experience outside of the classroom at least once per month.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will learn skills needed to effectively communicate with others.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will be able to identify problem solving methods needed to resolve conflict.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <p>Program – You should complete an <u>educational</u> program where you become an expert on conflict management and/or you host a community expert. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your program to your ASC.</p>
                
                <p>Bulletin Board - Your bulletin board should incorporate at least 2 approved resources (not in QR code form). One of the resources this month is a conflict style quiz, which might be fun to have as a QR code on your board, but should only be included in addition to 2 resources. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your bulletin board to your ASC.</p>

                    <li>Spend time in your lobby and encourage residents who come in to pledge to fight fair and avoid passive aggressive behavior or social media posting when angry/upset. Have them sign a banner.</li>

                    <li>Invite someone from Winthrop’s Human Resources department to discuss conflict in the workplace and how residents can put their best foot forward in preparing for the inevitable conflict in their future careers.</li>
