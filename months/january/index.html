                <p>No matter where you are in your Winthrop journey, it’s always relevant to think about making good academic decisions. For first year students, January is when they might panic about keeping scholarships after their first semester did not go as well as expected, and you can help them get connected with academic resources early in the semester. For those who did well, this could be a good time to push programs like ONCA, Honors, and working for on-campus tutoring organizations. For upperclassmen, it will be a good time to help them begin thinking about summer and fall internships and jobs. Help your residents make the best academic decisions and connect them to critical resources on campus.</p>
                
                <p>The learning outcomes met by this month’s bulletin board, program, and resident interactions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will actively engage in a learning experience outside of the classroom at least once per month.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will be able to assess their own need for a university support service as a result of living on campus.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Program – You should complete an <u>educational</u> program where you become an expert on academic decisions and/or you host a community expert. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your program to your ASC. If you are an ASC RA, you must also complete a <u>social</u> program for your residents during the month of January.</p>
                
                <p>Bulletin Board - Your bulletin board should incorporate at least 2 approved resources (not in QR code form). If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your bulletin board to your ASC.</p>
