                <p>February is a time when we tend to focus on love, and showcasing resilience is a great way to help your residents learn to love and advocate for themselves. Resilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties or setbacks. Help your residents learn how to bounce back from academic, personal, social, and professional struggles by encouraging positivity, good problem solving behaviors, and mental health maintenance.</p>
                
                <p>The learning outcomes met by this month’s bulletin board, program, and resident interactions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will actively engage in a learning experience outside of the classroom at least once per month.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will be able to identify problem solving methods needed to resolve conflict.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will be able to identify their values and understand how they impact their choices and actions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Program – You should complete an <u>educational</u> program where you become an expert on resiliency and/or you host a community expert. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your program to your ASC.</p>
                
                <p>Bulletin Board - Your bulletin board should incorporate at least 2 approved resources (not in QR code form). If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your bulletin board to your ASC.</p>
