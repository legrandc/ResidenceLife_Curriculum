                <p>After having spent a year on your floor, help residents reflect on all that they have gained from their residential community and ways that they can give back to that community, to Winthrop, and to the community at large through civic engagement and servant leadership. It’s time to pass the torch!</p>
                
                <p>The learning outcomes met by this month’s bulletin board, program, and resident interactions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will actively engage in a learning experience outside of the classroom at least once per month.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will be able to identify their values and understand how they impact their choices and actions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Program – You should complete an <u>educational</u> program where you become an expert on resiliency and/or you host a community expert. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your program to your ASC.</p>
                
                <p>Bulletin Board - Your bulletin board should incorporate at least 2 approved resources (not in QR code form). If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your bulletin board to your ASC.</p>

                    <li>Invite a former Peace Corps Volunteer or AmeriCorps VISTA to share their experience in serving on a larger scale.</li>
