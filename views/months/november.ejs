                <p>At a time of year when people are becoming more reflective, November’s topic will help residents reflect on what they are thankful for in their communities that you have helped to build with them. You will teach residents about the benefits of practicing gratitude and provide opportunities for them to do so.</p>
                
                <p>The learning outcomes met by this month’s bulletin board, program, and resident interactions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will actively engage in a learning experience outside of the classroom at least once per month.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will be able to identify their values and understand how they impact their choices and actions.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Community Commitment</b> - Residential students will develop connections and relationships within their residence halls.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <p>Program – You should complete an <u>educational</u> program where you become an expert on gratitude and/or you host a community expert. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your program to your ASC.</p>
                
                <p>Bulletin Board - Your bulletin board should incorporate at least 2 approved resources (not in QR code form). If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your bulletin board to your ASC.</p>
