                <p>March’s theme is all about cultural engagement and encouraging residents to think about and interact with cultures and communities outside of their own on a deeper level. Picture culture as an iceberg – many of us interact with the tip of the iceberg through music and food, but underneath is a wealth of information about values, religion, communication, family dynamics, and more. Experiences with surface and deep culture better equip residents to develop empathy and more positive relationships with others.</p>
                
                <p>The learning outcomes met by this month’s bulletin board, program, and resident interactions are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Academic Excellence</b> - Residential students will actively engage in a learning experience outside of the classroom at least once per month.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Self-Development</b> - Residential students will be able to identify their values and understand how they impact their choices and actions.</li>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Community Commitment</b> - Residential students will develop connections and relationships within their residence halls.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Program – You should complete an <u>educational</u> program where you become an expert on resiliency and/or you host a community expert. If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your program to your ASC.</p>
                
                <p>Bulletin Board - Your bulletin board should incorporate at least 2 approved resources (not in QR code form). If you are an ASC RA, you must connect your bulletin board to your ASC.</p>

                    <li>Invite a chef from Aramark to teach your residents how to cook a cuisine from another culture while you share information with your residents about that culture.</li>
                    <li>Create a scavenger hunt around your building where residents can visit different “countries” or areas around the building where you have information set up for them to learn.</li>
                    <li>Host an ice cream night and talk about the cultural iceberg with residents, or how most of the aspects of culture are deep (like history, values, manners, class, and religion) while most people tend to focus on surface culture (like music and food).</li>
                    <li>Host a movie night where the main character experiences a different culture and lead a discussion with your residents about stepping outside of your comfort zone.</li>
